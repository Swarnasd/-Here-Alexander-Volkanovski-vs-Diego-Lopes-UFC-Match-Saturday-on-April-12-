UFC 314 Main Event That title was vacated by the previous champion, Ilia Topuria, making this fight for the newly minted UFC featherweight champion.
Fight Background
Alexander Volkanovski: The ex-featherweight king is reeling from a rough stretch, as he has suffered two consecutive knockouts at the hands of Islam Makhachev and Ilia Topuria, respectively, in title fights. Following a 14-month sabbatical to recover and recalibrate, Volkanovski seeks to re-establish his supremacy in the featherweight ranks. Known as a master of distance control and grappling disengagement, Volkanovski ranks among the most technically gifted fighters in MMA history, his precision sometimes leaving observers aghast.
Diego Lopes: Lopes has a meteoric rise through featherweight, earning his 1st title dirvagen by beating elite competitors such in Brian Ortega,red Dan Ige. A dangerous power puncher with a strong ground game, Lopes excels when the action is heated and has demonstrated toughness under duress. But his takedown defense and wrestling could end up being his likely Achilles heel against a veteran and finely-tuned machine such as Volkanovski.
Key Factors in the Fight
Volkanovski’s Form: Having suffered two late-career knockout losses, it’s a question mark whether Volkanovski can regain the form of his peak years. If he fights like he did against Max Holloway or Yair Rodriguez, his superior striking technique and fight IQ might serve him to a significant extent.
Lopes Is Powerful And Aggressive Lopes has explosive power and is unorthodox. His knack for overwhelming opponents from the outset could be an issue for Volkanovski, especially since the Australian has shown recent susceptibility to being knocked out.
(Spanning Styles: Lopes has a dynamic submission game, as well as some wing-chunking scrambles, but Volkanovski's proven capable of keeping suffocating grapplers like Brian Ortega and Islam Makhachev at bay over 25 minutes.) Lopes’ challenge will be to look to take the fight to the ground without being opened up to counters.
Cardio and Championship Rounds: Volkanovski's stamina has been signature throughout his career, allowing him to overwhelm his foes in the latter part of fights. If Lopes fails to finish early, as Volkanovski takes advantage of openings, fatigue could play a role.
