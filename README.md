UFC 314 Main Event That title was vacated by the previousâ€‚champion, Ilia Topuria, making this fight for the newly minted UFC featherweight champion.
Fight Background
Alexander Volkanovski: The ex-featherweight king is reeling from a rough stretch, as he has suffered two consecutive knockouts at the hands of Islam Makhachev and Ilia Topuria, respectively, inâ€‚title fights. Followingâ€‚a 14-month sabbatical to recover and recalibrate, Volkanovski seeks to re-establish his supremacy in the featherweight ranks. Known as a master of distance control and grappling disengagement, Volkanovski ranks among the most technically gifted fighters in MMA history,â€‚his precision sometimes leaving observers aghast.
Diego Lopes: Lopes has a meteoric rise through featherweight, earning his 1st title dirvagen by beating elite competitorsâ€‚such in Brian Ortega,red Dan Ige. A dangerous power puncher with a strong ground game, Lopes excels when the action is heated and hasâ€‚demonstrated toughness under duress. But his takedown defense and wrestling could end up being his likely Achilles heel against a veteran and finely-tuned machine suchâ€‚as Volkanovski.
Key Factors in the Fight
Volkanovskiâ€™s Form: Having suffered two late-career knockout losses, itâ€™sâ€‚a question mark whether Volkanovski can regain the form of his peak years. If he fights like he did against Max Holloway or Yair Rodriguez, his superior striking techniqueâ€‚and fight IQ might serve him to a significant extent.

Lopes Is Powerful Andâ€‚Aggressive Lopes has explosive power and is unorthodox. His knack for overwhelming opponents from the outset could be an issue for Volkanovski, especially since the Australianâ€‚has shown recent susceptibility to being knocked out.
(Spanning Styles: Lopes has a dynamic submission game, as well as some wing-chunking scrambles, but Volkanovski's proven capable of keeping suffocating grapplers like Brian Ortegaâ€‚and Islam Makhachev at bay over 25 minutes.) Lopesâ€™ challenge will be to look to take the fight toâ€‚the ground without being opened up to counters.
Cardio and Championship Rounds: Volkanovski's stamina has been signature throughout his career, allowing him to overwhelm his foesâ€‚in the latter part of fights. If Lopes fails to finish early, as Volkanovski takes advantage of openings,â€‚fatigue could play a role.
